# Tenzies Game

A simple and fun dice-game built with React and Vite.

## 🎮 Project Overview

In this game, the goal is to roll the dice until **all ten dice show the same number**.  
You can click on individual dice to “freeze” them so they keep their value while you roll the rest.  
Once all dice match, the game ends and you have the option to start a new game.

## 🧰 Built With

- React (functional components + hooks)  
- Vite for development build tooling  
- CSS for styling  
- JavaScript (ES6+)
